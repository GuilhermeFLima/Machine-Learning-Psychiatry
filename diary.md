### April 1
Reformated the csv files so they are vertical and have header (a single column name which is just "0").
- Gonna check the verbal tasks individually now -> too cumbersome, will clean using functions.
- Removed unwanted periods.
- Removed underscores.
- Remove double underscores.
- Checked vector addition for nouns + adjectives. Seems good.

### April 4

- Removed prepositions and pronouns, might need to use more comprehensive list. This is in the Verbal Tasks redux folder.
- Performed some manual cleaning.
- There are still complex phrases present. Might just eliminate these using word counting.

### April 7

- added comments and "if \_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_' ".
- Script to reduce number of words in each verbal task entry.
-
